We have a project in TFS that has a non-English character (?) in it. When trying to script a few build-related things we've stumbled upon a problem - we can't pass the ? letter to the command line tools. Command prompt or what not else messes it up, and the tf.exe utility can't find the specified project.

I've tried different formats for the .bat file (ANSI, UTF-8 with and without BOM) as well as scripting it in JavaScript (which is Unicode inherently) - but no luck. Anybody have an idea how to excecute a program and pass it a Unicode command line?

Try:

chcp 65001
which will change the code page to UTF-8. Also, you need to use Lucida console fonts.
