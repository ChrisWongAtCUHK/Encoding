I thought unicode was the default for Windows??
However, try this:
Open Region and Language in the Control Panel,
Click the Administrative tab, and then, under Language for non-Unicode programs, click Change system locale. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
Select the language, and then click OK.
To restart your computer, click Restart now.
